            // Checkpoint 4.1 What are HTTP requests and reponses? What are the various HTTP verbs and what do they do?
            // Answer: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests and responses are fundamental components of communication on the World Wide Web. An HTTP request is made by a client (typically a web browser) to a server to retrieve or send information. It consists of a request method, headers, and optionally a message body. The server then processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, including a status code, headers, and a response body. The various HTTP verbs, also known as request methods, specify the action to be performed on a resource. Common HTTP verbs include GET (retrieve information), POST (submit data to be processed), PUT (update a resource), DELETE (remove a resource), and others. These verbs define the type of operation requested by the client, enabling a range of interactions and functionalities in web applications.

            // Checkpoint 4.2 What is the difference between callbacks, then-catch vs await-try-catch? When should you use one over the other
            // Answer: The difference between callbacks with `then-catch` and `async-await` lies in their approach to handling asynchronous code in JavaScript. Callbacks, used with `then-catch`, are traditional functions passed as arguments to asynchronous functions, suitable for scenarios where promise-based syntax is not available. On the other hand, `async-await` provides a more modern and readable syntax, allowing asynchronous code to resemble synchronous code. The `try-catch` structure in `async-await` is favored for its cleaner organization and is particularly useful when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations that need sequential execution. While callbacks with `then-catch` are still relevant in older code or when working with callback-based APIs, `async-await` is preferred in contemporary JavaScript development for its enhanced readability and maintainability, especially in scenarios involving promises.
